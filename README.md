# 🧠 AI Learning Gap Assistant

### Bloom-Aware Conceptual Tutor with Reflective Analytics and Learning Refinement

An AI-powered conceptual learning assistant that helps students bridge learning gaps through:

* Bloom Learning Levels
* Progressive refinement explanations
* Confidence-based reflection
* Revision-priority insights
* Structured learning summaries
* Lightweight learning analytics dashboard

Instead of only *answering questions*, the assistant supports:

✔ understanding  
✔ reflection  
✔ progressive clarity  
✔ learning reinforcement  

This project aligns with **SDG-4 — Quality Education** by enabling reflective, feedback-driven learning.

## 📌 Project Overview

Traditional AI chat responses provide answers — but they do not:

✘ assess learning depth  
✘ support cognitive learning levels  
✘ provide refinement-based explanations  
✘ capture confidence signals  
✘ identify weak topics  

This system shifts AI from:

> “Answer provider” → “Learning facilitator”

by encouraging:

* conceptual clarity  
* repeated scaffolding  
* reflective thinking  
* insight-driven revision
